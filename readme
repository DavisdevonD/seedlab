For the mini-project, we created Python code a3_mp.py
this code uses openCV to detect an aruco marker 
The location of the center of the marker is then detected 
After finding the center of the maker, the quadrant it is in is detected 
each quadrant is related to an integer 
The integer is sent to the Arduino
